Good day Sir. I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my sincere apologies for the late submission of 
my recent assignments for your CSC 312 class. I understand the importance of adhering to deadlines, and I deeply regret 
any inconvenience my delay may have caused. I encountered challenges in completing the assignment on time. Despite my best efforts to meet the deadline, 
I underestimated the time required to address these issues effectively. I assure you that I have made the steps to prevent such delays in the coming future.  
I understand if any late penalties apply, and I am willing to accept the consequences of my actions.

Once again, I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused. I appreciate your understanding and consideration in this matter. 
Thank You Sir.

												Yours Faithfully,
												Adewumi Oluwatofunmi Miracle
